Problem Statement:
Implement a hash map (dictionary) in C++ and Java that supports insert, delete, and get operations. Ensure that the hash map handles collisions using separate chaining.

Constraints:

The keys will be non-negative integers.
The values can be any integers.
The initial size of the hash map will be provided during its creation.
Handle collisions using separate chaining (linked list).
The number of operations will be between 1 and 10^4.
Input:

For insert: two integers key and value.
For delete: one integer key.
For get: one integer key.
Output:

For insert and delete: No output required.
For get: An integer value associated with the key, or -1 if the key does not exist.
Examples:

Initialization: HashMap map = new HashMap(10)
Operations:
insert(1, 10)
insert(2, 20)
get(1) returns 10
